# BasicBingoGame
A basic bingo game application given a specific ticket string.

Run the BingoChallenge/Pages/Bingo.html page. <br />
Just hit the Go! button and let the application determine which of the six strip tickets is the winning one.

Note:
This is a basic web application just to demonstrate code organizing, style and efficiency.
Additional features and scaling capabilities can be added by extending the core libraries used in the project.
